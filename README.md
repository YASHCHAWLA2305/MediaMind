# MediaMind
This project is an AI-powered dynamic execution agent that takes natural language instructions from the user, generates the required Python code using an LLM, safely cleans the code, and executes it dynamically.

Key Features
•	Natural Language to Code → Users can simply describe tasks (e.g., “open an Excel file and show me the first 5 rows”) without worrying about function names.
•	Dynamic Function Matching → The agent automatically detects and runs the right function from the generated code, even if the user doesn’t know the exact function name.
•	Excel-Friendly → Supports opening and processing Excel files (via pandas + openpyxl) with just a file path input.
•	Safe Execution → Code is sandboxed: only function definitions are retained, and dangerous operations (like exec, eval, system calls) are stripped.
•	Extensible → Add your own agents, utility functions, or domain-specific modules for different workflows (e.g., media audit, data validation).

🔧 Tech Stack
•	Python 3.10+
•	LangChain (LLM orchestration)
•	OpenAI / other LLMs for code generation
•	pandas for data handling
•	openpyxl for Excel processing

🚀 Use Cases
•	Automating Excel-based workflows (opening, validating, comparing datasets)
•	Building an AI assistant for data analysts that bridges natural language and code execution
•	Dynamic media audit & reporting agents
